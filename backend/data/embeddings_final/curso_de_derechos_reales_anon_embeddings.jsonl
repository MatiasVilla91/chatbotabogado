{"texto":"CUENTA - “CONVALIDACIÓN”- Éste principio se encuentra establecido en el art. [DIRECCIÓN], e implica una excepción al art. [DIRECCIÓN]“nadie puede transmitir a otro un derecho más extenso o mejor que el que tiene”.Cabe destacar que para transmitir un derecho real, por ej. El dominio, a otra persona, tengo que ser propietario y dueño del derecho real que estoy transmitiendo. Ahora bien éste principio de convalidación permite que si una persona no tiene el derecho y lo adquiere con posterioridad, la transmisión o constitución que haya realizado quedará convalidada, es decir se tendrá por válida retroactivamente al momento de la transmisión, por más que al momento de efectuarla no se tenía derecho a ella. Todos los derechos reales se pueden convalidar, incluso la hipoteca. JUSTO TITULO Ya hemos aclarado que para adquirir el derecho real necesitamos título (causal e instrumental) y modo suficiente.

{"texto":"que realmente interesa es probar actos posesorios, actos materiales que impliquen posesión, por ejemplo haber construido sobre el terreno, o haber hecho mejoras. Es muy frecuente creer que el testimonio de vecinos es único, y si bien es importante, no puede ser la única prueba a presentar. Ésta es la etapa más importante del juicio, es conveniente que junten toda la prueba que crean tener, ya que se admite toda clase de medio probatorio. Pero va a ser relevante siempre y cuando implique probar posesión. Por supuesto debe probarse que esos actos posesorios que alego se realizaron de manera pública, ostensible y continuada. En conclusión, debo probar el ánimo de dueño y el corpus (la posesión en sí). Se admite prueba documental, confesional, informativa, pericial, ocular, testimonial, pago de impuestos y tasas, etc. Luego viene la etapa de los alegatos, en donde cada parte debe valorar la prueba presentada.

{"texto":"que conocían o debían conocer la existencia del título del derecho real. (Por ejemplo el escribano no puede decir que no conocía la existencia del derecho real por más que no se haya inscripto, es decir frente a éste (quien debía conocer la existencia del acto), el derecho real ya le es oponible si media titulo y modo suficiente por más que no haya inscripción). En las cosas muebles en el momento mismo de la entrega ya nace el derecho (efecto constitutivo). Ahora bien, el efecto declarativo que es elque hace a la oponibilidad, a la publicidad frente a todos, lo tendremos también con la entrega de la cosa, es decir en el mismo momento lo hago constitutivo y le doy publicidad, ya que no hace falta inscribirlo en ningún registro. Esto es lo que se llama “publicidad posesoria”. Es decir basta con la sola entrega de la cosa.

{"texto":"negocio, es quien otorga el acto pero no le recaen a él los efectos del negocio jurídico. Por ej. El representante. Parte: Si les recae los efectos del negocio jurídico. Por ej., el representado. Nota: Cuando celebren un contrato de compraventa de inmueble, previo a realizar la escritura, es conveniente que abonen como mínimo el 25% del valor del inmueble, porque dicho pago genera derechos y posibilidades de reclamar judicialmente ante eventuales problemas, como por ejemplo el derecho de preferencia frente a medidas cautelares que se traben sobre el inmueble por terceros, recuerden que hasta que no se efectúe la escritura, el inmueble sigue a nombre del vendedor. Una vez firmado el boleto, celebren la escritura cuanto antes, si es posible dentro del mes. Generalmente el comprador, es el que tiene la oportunidad de elegir al escribano que realizará el acto notarial.

{"texto":"de los antecedentes y averiguaciones ya realizadas (con el plano de mensura y estudio de títulos), se requerirá mediante oficio librado por el juez y diligenciado por nosotros, al Registro de la Propiedad que informe, confirme o rectifique la presunta titularidad de dominio que conocemos en base a las medidas preparatorias que habíamos iniciado.
